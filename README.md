# Aadhaar Based voting system using blockchain technology

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Nodejs
Etherium


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

 1.The authority must login first with the provided session ID.
 2.The voter can now begin the process of voting with proper authentication through OTP(one time password) on the respective linked mobile number.
 3.If the voter is valid then the system will check for for the voters age and the address to which he can give vote.
 4.the voting pallete will be opned with  candidate names,their parties and logos.
 5.Now the voter can give his vote by clicking vote button.
 6.one voter can give his vote only once,i.e after one time voting buttons are disabled and the vote is automatically loged out.
 7.Same process continiues for many more votters irrespective of their voting wards.
### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why
 1.The authority login is to ensure security to prevent piracy,harresment and corruption from candidates standing in election.
 2.OTP generation is to authenticate the right aadhar card owner.
 3.button disabling and automatic logout is to prevent multiple voting by single candidate. 

## Deployment

The Aadhaar based voting system is developed to overcome the flaws of EVM system. So directly EVM will be replaced by touch screen interface having the great
user interfase and high security.
